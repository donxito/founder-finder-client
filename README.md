# Founder Finder Frontend

Founder Finder is a web application where users can search for potential co-founders. 

Finding a co-founder is hard, we provide you with the platform to make that easier. Building a start-up is hard work. It is a journey to create something new and it takes believing in a dream each and every day, often against all odds.

Finding a co-founder is one of the most difficult parts of the process. The goal is to find someone that completes you, someone that will share the burdens and the joys along the way. 

This repository contains the code for the client-side of the application, built using TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.
